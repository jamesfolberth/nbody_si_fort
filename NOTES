data location
=============
executables assume that the data dir is ../data, relative to src/

GNU Octave's load (since I built it with hdf5-openmpi) will accept an HDF5 data file


compiling + linking
===================
Use ldd exec_file to determine if the proper dyn. libs are going to load at runtime

Use -Wl,-rpath=/dir/to/add to add the dir to the ld runtime search path (alternative to export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/dir/to/add)

Do this with absolute path names


LSODE
=====
Adams multistep - method flag mf=10, no jacobian used
I can give it the work arrays and just ask it to give me the value at TOUT (which should be all I need).
New system at every time step, so ISTATE = 1
