# Symplectic Integrator for the N-Body Problem
At the end of my Senior year in undergrad, I wrote some MATLAB code that integrated the orbits the outer planets for 1 Gyr.  This Fortran code accomplishes the same task (but about 130 times faster!) and also approximates the largest Lyapunov exponent of Pluto.
